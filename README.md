This project is aimed to set up end to end Machine Learning (ML) pipeline for wake word detection in Conversational AI. 

## Scope of the project
In conversational AI, when a voice assistant is turned on, it has to detect the wake word in order to respond the queries / converstations made by human.(Preferably). However in this project, more focus will be emphasized on end to end ML pipeline (from MLops perspective) instead of model accuracy, hyperparamater tuning.
